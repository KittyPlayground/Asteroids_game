## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the **Asteroids Game** built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves navigating a spaceship in space, dodging and shooting asteroids to score points while avoiding collisions. The player can control the ship with the keyboard and interact with the game elements through different gameplay mechanics.

## Features

- **Spaceship Control**: Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship and the spacebar to shoot.
- **Asteroid Movement**: Asteroids randomly appear and move across the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Avoid colliding with asteroids. If a collision occurs, the game restarts.
- **Game Over**: If the spaceship collides with an asteroid, the game is over.
- **Astronaut**: An astronaut image appears on the game screen, adding a fun touch.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game elements and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, controls, collision detection, and rendering.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in any modern browser.
2. Use the **arrow keys** to move the spaceship.
3. Press the **spacebar** to shoot at the asteroids.
4. Avoid the asteroids; if you collide, the game will reset.
5. Try to survive as long as possible and rack up points!
